## Solution 1: Single Instance (Dev Env)

1. Create an Amazon EC2 instance and use a configuration management tool such as Ansible to configure it as a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).

2. Use AWS Certificate Manager to create a self-signed SSL certificate and configure the web server to use HTTPS with this certificate.

3. Set up security groups to allow only HTTPS (port 443) traffic to your instance.

4. Use Route53 to route traffic to your instance.

5. Use CloudWatch for monitoring and CloudTrail for logging.
