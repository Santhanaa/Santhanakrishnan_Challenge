# Architecture Overview:

Our architecture will consist of the following components:
- **Amazon S3**: For reliable website hosting.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: As the content delivery network (CDN) to improve performance and reduce latency.
- **Amazon Route 53**: For domain name system (DNS) management.
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**: To provision a secure SSL/TLS certificate.
- **Bash Script**: To automate deployment and testing.

## Steps:

### 1. Create an S3 Bucket:

- Create an S3 bucket to host your static website files. Set the bucket policy to allow public read access.
- Upload your HTML file (with "Hello World!" content) to the bucket.

### 2. Configure CloudFront:

- Create a CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin.
- Configure the distribution to use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) by associating the ACM certificate.
- Set up a default behavior to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.

### 3. Set Up Route 53:

- Create a hosted zone in Route 53 for your domain.
- Add a record set (type A or CNAME) pointing to your CloudFront distribution.

### 4. Bash Script for Automation:

Write a bash script that:
- Creates the S3 bucket.
- Uploads the HTML file.
- Creates the CloudFront distribution.
- Sets up the Route 53 record.
- Validates the setup.

### 5. Automated Tests:

Develop automated tests to validate the correctness of the server configuration.
Test the following:
- Ensure the website is accessible via HTTPS.
- Verify that HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
- Confirm that the "Hello World!" content is displayed.

## Security Considerations:

- Use a self-signed certificate for testing purposes. In production, consider using a valid ACM certificate.
- Restrict public access to only necessary ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS).
- Implement proper IAM roles and permissions for services.
- Regularly review security groups and network ACLs.
